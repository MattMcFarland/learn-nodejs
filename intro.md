# What is node?
- Runtime system
- It works with your file system
- It works with any input, does logic, and gives output
- It is async
- its not a webserver.

# How to get?
- First download nodejs at nodejs.org
  - reset the machine, if you are too lazy, then skip step.
  - open command line, run `node -v` and `npm -v`
- If you run into errors with node / npm command `node -v` / `npm -v` then restart machine
- You will also need GIT
  - linux - `sudo apt-get install git -y`
  - osx, you can use something like brew or port
  - you can also just download an installer (google git installer)
- You will also need a C++ compiler
